**Zygisk-Loader** is a stealthy, high-performance Zygisk module written in **Rust**. It acts as a universal bridge that dynamically injects external shared libraries (`.so`) into specific Android application processes.

Unlike traditional modules that require rebuilding and rebooting, **Zygisk-Loader** enables a **"Hot-Swap" workflow**. You can recompile your instrumentation library, push it to the device, and simply restart the target app to apply changes instantly.

## Key Features

*   **Hot-Swap Capable**: Update your payload (`.so`) and deploy instantly by just restarting the target app. No device reboot required.
*   **Robust Injection**: Uses a **RAM-Buffering Strategy**. The payload is read into memory with Root privileges, then written to the app's cache in the post-specialize phase. This ensures compatibility with strict SELinux policies and isolated processes.
*   **Stealthy (Self-Deleting)**: The payload is written to disk, loaded, and **immediately unlinked**. The file vanishes from the filesystem instantly, leaving minimal traces for file scanners.
*   **Zygisk API v5**: Utilizes the latest Zygisk API for maximum compatibility with Magisk, KernelSU, and APatch.
*   **Config-Driven**: Simple text-based configuration. No hardcoded package names.
*   **Rust-Powered**: Built with safety and performance in mind using the `jni` and `libc` crates.

## Architecture

Zygisk-Loader separates the **Injector** (The Module) from the **Payload** (Your Logic). It bridges the permission gap between the Zygote process (Root) and the App process (Untrusted).

    subgraph Storage [" /data/adb/modules/zygisk-loader/config/ "]
        Config[("target")]
        PayloadBin[("payload.so")]
    end

    subgraph Zygote [" Zygote Process (Root) "]
        Step1[Read Target Config]
        Step2[Buffer Payload to RAM]
    end

    subgraph App [" Target App Process (User UID) "]
        Fork((Fork))
        Step3[Write RAM to App Cache]
        Step4[dlopen Cache File]
        Step5[unlink Cache File]
        Logic[Payload Active]
    end

    Config --> Step1
    PayloadBin --> Step2
    Step2 --> Fork
    Fork --> Step3
    Step3 --> Step4
    Step4 --> Step5
    Step4 -.-> Logic
    Step5 -.->|Artifact Removed| App
```

## Directory Structure

After installation, the module creates a configuration directory:

```text
/data/adb/modules/zygisk-loader/
├── module.prop
├── zygisk/
│   └── ...
└── config/              <-- WORKSPACE
    ├── target           (File containing the target package name)
    └── payload.so       (Your compiled library)
```

## Usage

### 1. Installation
1. Download the latest release `.zip`.
2. Flash via Magisk / KernelSU / APatch.
3. Reboot device.

### 2. Configuration & Deployment
You can control the loader using ADB or a root shell.

**A. Set Target Application:**
Write the package name of the target app to the config file:
```bash
echo "com.target.application" > /data/adb/modules/zygisk-loader/config/target
```

**B. Deploy Payload:**
Copy your compiled Rust/C++ library to the config folder:
```bash
# Copy your hook library
cp libunpin.so /data/adb/modules/zygisk-loader/config/payload.so

# Set permissions (Important for Zygote to read it)
chmod 644 /data/adb/modules/zygisk-loader/config/payload.so
```

**C. Apply (Hot-Swap):**
Force stop the target application. The next time it launches, the loader will inject the new payload.
```bash
am force-stop com.target.application
```

## Developing a Payload

Your payload does not need to know about Zygisk. It acts as a standard shared library. In Rust, we recommend using the `ctor` crate for automatic initialization.

`Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
ctor = "0.2"
android_logger = "0.13"
log = "0.4"
```

`src/lib.rs`:
```rust
use ctor::ctor;
use log::LevelFilter;
use android_logger::Config;

#[ctor]
fn init() {
    android_logger::init_once(
        Config::default().with_max_level(LevelFilter::Info).with_tag("GhostPayload")
    );
    
    // logic hooking start here
    log::info!("Hello from inside the target application!");
    log::info!("I have been loaded and my file on disk is already gone.");
}
```

## Technical Constraints

*   **SELinux Compatibility**: This module uses disk injection (Write-Load-Unlink) instead of `memfd` to ensure maximum compatibility across all Android versions and SELinux contexts. `memfd` often fails on `untrusted_app` domains due to `execmem` restrictions.
*   **Isolated Processes**: The loader automatically handles isolated processes (e.g., `:remote` services) by resolving the correct data directory path.
